          I believe Skills are the ability to perform certain tasks well. Some
          skills can be measured and you acquire them through deliberate effort,
          others are related to your personality traits. In other words, not all
          skills are created equal. That’s why we call some of them “hard” and
          others “soft”.<strong>Hard skills</strong> are the skills that I’ve
          acquired through deliberate effort. They can be learned, taught, and
          measured.My hard skills include:
          <strong
            >HTML, CSS, Python, SQL, JavaScript, MachineLearning, C++, C, Data
            structures and Algorithm, Competitive Programming and
            others.</strong
          >
          <strong>Soft skills</strong>, on the other hand, are closely tied to
          one’s personality traits. Some of my softskills are
          <strong
            >leadership, communication, or other interpersonal skills</strong
          >. As opposed to hard skills, soft skills cannot be easily taught.
          Examples of soft skills include: problem-solving, negotiating,
          multitasking, time management, presenting, and others.
